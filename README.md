# Fast Food Category App

This is a React-based single-page application (SPA) that serves as an on-page fast food menu. It allows users to view a variety of food items organized into different categories. Users can search for specific food items using Axios to fetch data from an API hosted on a server.

This project was inspired by a course from [ClassBon](https://www.classbon.com/) to create a dynamic and user-friendly fast food menu application.
